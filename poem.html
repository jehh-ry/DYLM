    <h2>For the one who makes my heart smile 💖</h2>

    <p>Your smile is the sunrise that melts away my fears,</p>
    <p>A gentle light that dries my quiet tears.</p>
    <p>Your voice, a lullaby the heavens must’ve sung,</p>
    <p>Soft as moonlight, sweet as spring on tongue.</p>

    <p>When I see you, time forgets to move,</p>
    <p>The world slows down to watch you soothe.</p>
    <p>In your eyes, I see galaxies unfold,</p>
    <p>Stories of love, in whispers told.</p>

    <p>You’re the poem my heart began to write,</p>
    <p>Long before I held a pen or knew the night.</p>
    <p>The dream that lingers when morning's near,</p>
    <p>The echo I chase but always hear.</p>

    <p>With you, even silence has a song,</p>
    <p>A rhythm where only hearts belong.</p>
    <p>Your touch rewrites what love can be,</p>
    <p>A tender truth that sets me free.</p>

    <p>If stars could speak, they’d speak your name,</p>
    <p>Lighting up the dark with love’s pure flame.</p>
    <p>And if I had one wish tonight,</p>
    <p>It’d be to hold you close till morning light.</p>

    <p>So take this poem — it’s all for you,</p>
    <p>A piece of my soul, soft and true.</p>
    <p>Have a beautiful day, my love, my muse,</p>
    <p>I love you more than words can use.</p>
    <p>Kisses and hugs, forever yours 💖😘</p>
